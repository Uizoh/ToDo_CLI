# Yet another simple CLI ToDo list made in Python

Uses JSON to store the todo list in the same directory.  
*TODO: Add encription options*

### Usage

A task must be initiated under a **Title** for ease or organization.  
A title is like a group that couples a bunch of tasks together.  
There can be more than one title with their own independent tasks.  
To deleting a specific task, you must nevigate to it. Same with titles.  
Deleting a title will also delete all the under-lying tasks.
